Responsive website instructions using html and css

---> understanding units 
     -px
          ( the value height and width sets in px is fixed in landscape screen  and cannot move or responsive to any 
         other device)
     -% 
           (percentage sets and are responsive according to the parent div or element )
     -vw $ vh
           (veiwport-width $ veiwport-height: the height and widthsets in vw and vh are not  according to any parent or 
            main div . it sets and responsive according to the whole page landscape or portrait. we can also set font-size
            using vw and vh . the font size using vh is smaller then fontsize using vw in the landscape screen )
     -vmax & vmin
            (--vmax  : while  reducing the size of landscape screen  when the width of the screen is less then the height or when
            the height increases then the vw property changes into vh.
            --vmin : it is opposite to the vmax, it response first according to the vh and then at perticular stage it changes 
            into the vw)
     -em , rem
            (em : its mostly used with the childern elements and its font size , height, width depends on the parent element.
            for example the fontsize of the parent div is 20px and having inner element 1em . and if we sets 2em it means the 
            double of the font size and so on...
            rem : In rem , r basically stands for the root which means it depends on the size of the screen. the value of one rem
            is 60px . 1 rem = 60px , 2 rem = 120px and so on...)       

    

---> layout of website 
                  - absolute vs flex?
            (try to not  use absolute property becouse it is not responsive. we have to use the property display : flex; justify 
            content use for the cross access ( y-axes) and align items are used for the main axes (x-axes) )     



---> flexbox
       - Display flex
       - aligining items in x and y axes
       - flex direction 
       - flex wrap



---> CSS Media Queries
       - min height, min width
       - min width, max width



---> Use the calc() function to mantain the height and width



---> points to keep in mind to make a website responsive

1. CSS flexbox
2. CSS units
3. Responsive Typography
4. Mobile-First Approach
5. Flexible Images nad Media 
6. html , body {
      height = 100%;
      width = 100%
}
