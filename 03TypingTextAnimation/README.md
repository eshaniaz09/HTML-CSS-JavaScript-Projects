Project-03: TypingTextAnimtion

 This code creates a simple typing text animation effect on a webpage. 
The HTML code creates a container div with two child divs, one for the first line of text and one for the second line of text. 
The CSS code sets the styles for the container and the text divs. The container is centered on the page and has a black background. The text divs are positioned absolutely and have a white color. 
The JavaScript code uses the setInterval() function to repeatedly call a function that changes the innerHTML property of the second text div. This creates the effect of the text being typed out one character at a time.
