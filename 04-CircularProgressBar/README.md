Project-04 Circular Progress Bar Project

This project, features an interactive circular progress bar implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The index.html file in this directory serves as the main entry point. The circular progress bar is designed to visually represent progress using a conic gradient background, smoothly transitioning from a starting color to an ending color as the progress value changes. This README provides a brief overview of the project's location and purpose, offering a starting point for anyone interested in exploring or contributing to the project further.
